          <h3>Scratch Game Project</h3>
          <p>For this project, I worked with a partner to develop a game on Scratch. We worked together to code out how the game should function and what the visuals would look like. I worked with Lemual Sumardy to complete this project. We worked together to create the game's look and it's functions. We were aiming to create a turn based rpg game in Scratch. There were parts where we had to wait for each other to finish a task before we could continue, or some parts where we couldn't find out what errors were in the code.</p>

        <h3>MIT App Inventor</h3>
        <p>I worked with a partner to do this project. We worked together in order to figure out how to get everything to function properly and find bugs in our project. We had many ideas to choose from, but our group chose to do the photobooth app. We worked together to recreate the existing photobooth code, and after helping each other with creating the default program, we began to implement our own ideas into the application to make it special. There were multiple times where we had to figure out why our app was not being presented correctly, but we worked together to find a solution to eliminating the problem.</p>

        <h3>Image Malipulation</h3>
        <p>I worked by myself to complete this project. The goal that I had to achieve was to add geometrical shapes to the image because the client had an interest in geometrical shapes. I kept my ideas simple, and was able to complete the task while fullfilling all the requirnments. I faced multiple obstacles when developing this program, and having a partner to help me would have helped complete the project faster. I could improve of how well I was able to fullfill the requirnemnts, but I was able to figure out how to make things work.</p>
