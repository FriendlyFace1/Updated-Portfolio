          <p> I am a high schooler that is interested in coding. I know how to do HTML and CSS. I am currently learning how to do python. I have worked with multiple people on different coding projects.
            I have many activities that I enjoy doing, such as drawing and gaming. I like to draw my own kinds of characters, but I sometimes recreate some characters in my own art style. This is only one of the many things that I enjoy doing.
            I prioritize doing work first before doing other things, since I know that I have to finish what is important first. I don't rush through it either, I try to do the best I can on what I have to do along with getting it done. I have practiced swimming and badminton in my own time.
          </p>
          <p> I plan to use my experience in computer science to aid me in tasks in different areas, such as designing an organized storyboard for an animation idea or game plot. I am working towards being a developer of a popular game or be a graphics designer. To improve my mastery in computer science, I have been studying and practicing different kinds of coding languages so I can reach my goals more efficiently.</p>
